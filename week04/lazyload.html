      <h2>About Helmut</h2>
      <p>
        Helmut is a charming and expressive orange-and-white cat with a gentle personality 
        and bright, curious eyes. His soft, patterned coat and long white whiskers give him 
        a playful yet elegant look. Helmut is deeply attached to his owner, <strong>Alonso</strong>, 
        and their bond is easy to see—Helmut feels completely comfortable and safe whenever 
        he’s with him. Whether he’s resting, exploring, or posing for a photo, Helmut always 
        brings warmth and energy to every moment.
